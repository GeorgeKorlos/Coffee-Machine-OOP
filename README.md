This project simulates a coffee vending machine using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python. It allows users to select from a menu of drinks, processes payments, and dispenses coffee while managing resources.

The project consists of four main Python files:

main.py: The entry point of the application.
coffee_maker.py: Contains the CoffeeMaker class responsible for managing the coffee machine's resources.
menu.py: Contains the Menu and MenuItem classes, which model the drinks menu.
money_machine.py: Contains the MoneyMachine class, responsible for processing and managing payments.
